# Homework 4: a python query language (PyQL)
#
# In this assignment, we will use python to implement a little query
# language for CSV files. We'll write a bunch of little query objects
# that compose nicely to form larger more interesting queries.
#
# Our database is a CSV file, which forms a table similar to an Excel
# spreadsheet. Each line in the file is a row, and each row is
# separated into cells by commas.
#
# The first row contains the headers, which are the names of data
# stored in the corresponding cell of each subsequent row. In other
# words, the headers give names to each column in the table.
#
# Here's an example of a CSV table containing 2 rows of data about
# some people:
#
# Name,Age,Hair
# Steve,25,Blonde
# Bob,33,No
# Alice,27,Brown
#
# Interpretation:
# The person named Steve is 25 years old and has Blonde hair.
# The person named Bob is 33 years old and has no hair.
# The person named Alice is 27 years old and has Brown hair.
#
# I've included two CSV files to work with: player_career.csv and
# player_career_short.csv (the second is just the first 10 lines of
# the first). These are some basketball statistics taken from
# http://www.databasebasketball.com/
#
# The header abbreviations are described on the page:
# http://basketballreference.com/about/aboutstats.htm


# NOTE: unlike homework 3, this homework is linear:
# You don't need to read the whole thing before getting
# started. You should work through it beginning to end. 


#################### STEP 1 ####################
# Converting between CSV rows and dictionaries.
#
# Implement rowStringToDict and rowDictToString
################################################

def rowStringToDict(headers, ln):
    valuesList = ln.split(",")
    dictionary = {}
    for x in range (0, len(valuesList)):
        dictionary[headers[x]] = valuesList[x]
    return dictionary

assert(rowStringToDict(['Name','Age','Hair'], 'Steve,25,Blonde') == {'Name' : 'Steve', 'Age' : '25', 'Hair' : 'Blonde'})

def rowDictToString(headers, dict):
    lnArray  = []
    lnString = ""
    for x in headers:
        lnArray.append(str(dict[x]))
    lnString = ",".join(lnArray)
    return lnString

assert(rowDictToString(['Name','Age','Hair'], {'Name' : 'Steve', 'Age' : '25', 'Hair' : 'Blonde'}) == 'Steve,25,Blonde')

#####################  Queries ##########################
# You will define multiple small queries, which can 
# be composed into larger queries. Each query works by
# processing multiple rows one by one. The query can
# update the row (by adding/removing/changing columns),
# delete the entire row, or leave it unchanged.
# The query can also do an aggregation by updating its state.
# Once all rows have been processed, we can get the result of
# the aggregation. The aggregate is always single row containing
# zero or more columns.
#
# The query interface consists of the following methods and properties:
#
# methods:
#   process_row:       ---   Process an input row (in dictionary form).
#                            Returns an updated row or None if the row is to be deleted.
#   get_aggregate:     ---   Once all input rows have been processed,
#                            return the row of aggregated values.
#
# properties:
#   input_headers      ---   the headers (column names; dictionary keys) of the query's input rows
#   output_headers     ---   the headers of the query's output rows
#   aggregate_headers  ---   the headers of the query's aggregate row
#
# Query constructors take two inputs: the input_headers of the table
# it will be operating on, and a list of arguments. The constructor
# should consume values from the list of arguments (mutating the list).
###########################################################

# Here are two example queries (Identity and Count) I've provided for you.

class Identity:
    """
    Do nothing. Takes no arguments. Returns each row unchanged and does no aggregation.

    Example: running the Identity query on the file 'player_career_short.csv' should
    output the same file:

    Later, you can run this query from the command line via:
    $ python3 hw4.py player_career_short.csv -Identity

    Now to run the query, we must:
      print the output headers.

      for each line from f:
        convert the line to a dictionary of the form expected by the query.
        ask the query to process the row.
        if the query gives us an output row, print it in CSV form
    
      Once we're done processing the input rows, we need to print the aggregate table.

      Does the query even have an aggregate table? I.e. is aggregate_headers non-empty?
      If yes, print a blank line, then the aggregate headers, then the row of aggregate values.

class Filter:
    """
    Return only the rows that pass a check. Consumes a single argument from args, which
    is a python expression. For each row, check whether that row should be in the output
    by evaluating the expression. If the expression evaluates to True, then return the 
    row unchanged. If the expression evaluates to False, return None.

    Does no aggregation.

    Tip: use python's eval function to evaluate a string of python source code.
         See help(eval)

    Examples of eval:
        eval('1 + 2')   # evaluates to 3
        
    eval can take in an environment as its second argument, which binds values to variables
    in the expression. Use this feature to allow the expression to refer to the columns by name.

        eval('x + y', {'x' : 1, 'y' : 2})   # evaluates to 3

    Example: Players that played at least 500 games

    $ python3 hw4.py player_career_short.csv -Filter 'int(gp) > 500'

    """ 
    Compose two queries into a larger query.

    The rows are processed serially: the output of the first query's process_row
    method is the input to the second queries process_row method. Note that the 
    first query could drop the row by returning None (Filter). In this case, you
    should not call the second query's process_row.

    You should "typecheck" the composition by checking that the first query's
    output_headers match the second query's input_headers.

    The input_headers of the composite are the input_headers of the first query.
    The output_headers of the composite are the output_headers of the second query.

    The aggregate row of the composite is the concatenation of the aggregates from
    the first and second query.

    You should ensure that the aggregate_headers of each input query are *distinct* --
    they should have no common elements. 

    Tip: use the update method on dictionaries to combine two dictionaries. 
         d = {'a' : 1, 'b' : 2}
         d.update({'c' : 3, 'd' : 4})
         print(d) # prints {'d': 4, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'a': 1}
    
    Note that ComposeQueries.__init__ does not take in_headers or args as input!
    q1 and q2 have already been constructed. We're simply combining them.

# Test them! Come up with some more tests of your own!!!
#
# CELEBRATE!!!!!!
#
# Some larger queries to try:
#
# Example: Maximum number of points per minute. Filter out players that played 0 minutes to prevent divide by zero.
#
# $ python3 hw4.py player_career.csv -Filter 'float(minutes) > 0' -Add ppm 'float(pts)/float(minutes)' -MaxBy ppm ppm
#
# Example: Show the first and last names of the players with the maximum points per game, and the maximum number of points per minute.
#
# $ python3 hw4.py player_career.csv -Filter 'float(minutes) > 0' -Add first_last 'firstname + " " + lastname' -Add ppg 'float(pts)/float(gp)' -Add ppm 'float(pts)/float(minutes)' -MaxBy first_last ppg -MaxBy first_last ppm
#
# Example: Now include maximum values of pointsPerGame and pointsPerMinute, and end with -Filter 'False' to show only the aggregate row.
#
# $ python3 hw4.py player_career.csv -Filter 'float(minutes) > 0' -Add first_last 'firstname + " " + lastname' -Add ppg 'float(pts)/float(gp)' -Add ppm 'float(pts)/float(minutes)' -MaxBy first_last ppg -MaxBy ppg ppg -MaxBy first_last ppm -MaxBy ppm ppm -Filter 'False'
#
# Example: Count the number of players with at least 1 point per minute on average.
#
# $ python3 hw4.py player_career.csv -Filter 'int(minutes) > 0' -Add ppm 'float(pts)/float(minutes)' -Filter 'float(ppm) > 1' -Count
